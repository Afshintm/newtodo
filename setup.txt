1- I removed a property from gruntfile wiredep 
2- I install npm grunt-contrib-xxx something regarding images to workaround the error 
3- I changed the port to run 
4- to run the app run 
grunt serve 
grunt test for tests 

to install karma dependany for you project if does not not exist install karma like this 

	npm install karma --save-dev
	npm install karma-jasmine karma-chrome-luncher --save-dev

then your karma and it's dependancies will be installed on node-module folder and you will have to run Karma tests like this 

	node-modules\karma start test\karma.conf.js
and as it is a pain to type this everytime you are going to run unit tests, you can install Karma comman line interface globally like this 
	npm install -g karma-cli


	got from following article 
	http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/intro/installation.html


	webSiteHostAddress/index1.html is a sample to show javascript classes in effect it uses scripts\libs\atlib.js
